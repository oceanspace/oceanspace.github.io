I am very impressed with the resources the <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">climatechange.ai</a> community has compiled. Here are a few of my favorites.   

This paper outlines opportunities where machine learning can help address the many societal challenges posed by climate change. Peruse the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05433.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> for all the details, or the <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/summaries" target="_blank">interactive summary</a> for highlights.  

One of the leaders of this group was recently featured on <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/beyond-forecasting-artificial-intelligence-is-a-powerful-decarbonization-tool" target="_blank">a podcast</a> by Greentech Media, which was a nice way to hear some of the key application areas in an interview format.  

Want to learn about climate science? These are some free lecture series. They go pretty far in depth, but the essentials are covered in the beginning third or so of these courses (intro/overview, energy budget, greenhouse gases)
