I've been listening to [this podcast](https://brenebrown.com/podcast/introducing-unlocking-us/) nonstop lately, and was just recently shared this video which is a perfect synopsis of Brene Brown's thesis.

[Bren√© Brown: The Biggest Myth About Vulnerability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkDaKKkFi6Y)

I've been preparing and giving presentations for virtual meetings, which is a lot less nerve-racking than speaking in public in real life. I recently remembered this note card I made during grad school. I'd bring this along to conferences and sneak a look before going up on stage. The most important lesson for me from this is that the fear of public speaking isn't something that I'll ever permanently overcome. Rather, practice is all about getting used to that discomfort instead of making it go away.

I'm pretty sure the content on the back side is from the book [Presentation Zen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1908456.Presentation_Zen).
