I couldn't find a copy of Scott Hartley's _The Fuzzy and the Techie_ at my local library, so I went looking for a relevant podcast as I often do. I found [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99exfYtPBQ&t=1s), which I found to be a fascinating conversation. Apparently I wrote down this quote in a notebook lying around. 

> Just because something is digitally encoded, just because it's in ones and zeroes, just because it's pumped through an algorithm, doesn't mean it's objective, doesn't mean that it's become more true than anything else, and so we still have to leverage critical thinking skills of delineating between what we believe and what we don't believe.
