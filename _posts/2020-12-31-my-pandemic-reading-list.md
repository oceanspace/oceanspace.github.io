My reading list for 2020.  

Themes: gender, race, and writing to cope with difficulty. 


[Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33585392-dear-ijeawele-or-a-feminist-manifesto-in-fifteen-suggestions?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=U7URQtkbhZ&rank=1){:target="_blank"}

[Solutions and Other Problems by Allie Brosh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51323365-solutions-and-other-problems){:target="_blank"}
This book made me laugh so hard and rang so painfully true at the same time that I was uncontrollably crying through this. 

And some final sentiments, beautifully captured by Sonya Renee Taylor
