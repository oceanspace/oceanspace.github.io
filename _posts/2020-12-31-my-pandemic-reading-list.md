### My reading list for 2020

#### Themes: gender, race, and writing to cope with difficulty 
<br/>

[Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie](https://www.chimamanda.com/book/dear-ijeawele-or-a-feminist-manifesto-in-fifteen-suggestions/)  
<br/>

[I'm Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness by Austin Channing Brown](http://austinchanning.com/the-book)  
<br/>

[Solutions and Other Problems by Allie Brosh](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/)<br/>
This book made me laugh so hard and rang so painfully true at the same time that I was uncontrollably crying through this.  
<br/>

[Zen in the Art of Writing by Ray Bradbury](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/103761.Zen_in_the_Art_of_Writing)  
<br/> 

[For the Love of Men: From Toxic to a More Mindful Masculinity by Elizabeth Plank](http://www.elizabethplank.com/book)<br/>
My reading of this book was inspired by Dax Shepard's awareness-raising conversations around toxic masculinity.  
<br/>

[All We Can Save edited by Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson & Dr. Katharine K. Wilkinson](https://www.allwecansave.earth/)<br/>
Just beautiful.  
<br/>
