Turning our values into time: 
Look at values as the attributes of the person you want to become. 

Think about 3 life domains.
1. How would the person you want to become *invest in themselves*? 
2. How much time would the person you want to become *invest in relationships*? 
3. Work domains: 2 kinds ... Reflective vs. Reactive 
  - reactive: the pings the dings.
  - reflective: making time for traction. how do we carve out time for our day to think?
