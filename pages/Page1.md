--> <a href="https://carpentrieslab.github.io/python-aos-lesson/" target="_blank">atmosphere and ocean lessons</a>
<br> domain specific data workshops, including python for atmosphere and ocean netCDF files
<br> 
#### [whirlwind tour of python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/tree/master/)
Follow along with this series of Jupyter Notebooks.

## on my github 
#### <a href="https://github.com/oceanspace/DatabricksHackathon" target="_blank">Winning Hackathon Submission & Geospatial Tutorial</a>
The code for a [winning submission](https://data-teams-unite.devpost.com/project-gallery) to the SPARK+AI Summit 2020 Hackathon for Social Good. The same data is used in a tutorial for getting started with geospatial data in Python (see folder "WiDS Tutorial" for presentation and accompanying notebook) 
<br>
#### <a href="https://github.com/oceanspace/coursera-machine-learning-exercises" target="_blank">machine learning exercises</a>
my solutions for the exercises in <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning class</a> translated to python. Exercises 1-4 are available for now, I will possibly resume this later on. 
<br>
#### <a href="https://github.com/oceanspace/Chesapeake-Bay-machine-learning-tutorial" target="_blank">machine learning for an estuarine water quality dataset</a> 
I started adapting the exercises above to data from the <a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/what/downloads/cbp_water_quality_database_1984_present" target="_blank">
Chesapeake Bay Program water quality dataset</a>. Only one exercise for now, possibly more to come.
